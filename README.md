# PythonAssessment
My assessment question included what are the test scenarios that would fail with these since I haven't handled any exceptions it would fail 
a).For incorrect username and password combinations, 
b)Trying to select items from different catalogue of products since I have to stuck to only phones in this one. 
c)It might also fail for loading of pages mostly when getting to the cart and deleting the items since the page is getting refreshed often. 
d)Created methods for add and delete in such a way I should be able to add more than one product at a time.(Parameterised select product xpath)
